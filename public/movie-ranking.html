<h1>The Best Movies According to Louie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Amazing Spider-Man(1&2)</h3>
<p>Spider-Man is the greatest super hero ever created, These movies have one of my favorite versions of Peter Parker's
    story!
</p>
<h3>Waynes World</h3>
<p>The sound track is excellent, Cassandra sings all her own vocals, Wayne and Garth are an elite duo. PARTY ON!</p>
<h3>Dazed and Confused</h3>
<p>A feel good movie about the 70's. Must watch stoned!</p>
